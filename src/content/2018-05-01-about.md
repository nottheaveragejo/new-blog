## The Impossible Dream

Dear Reader,

A chant that heralds salvation and the end. Worlds where endless, renewable energy is possible, along with deeply engrained, unconscious racial biases. A corpulent, bloated ruler who barely sits in the seat of power.

Sei Tana is a girl that wants to honor the promises she made to her father. To attend the prestigious Jinsil academy and lead a peaceful, unremarkable life. Yet, her curious mind codes into being programs that can be the salvation of millions or be used in their destruction. Her desire to expand scientific knowledge are threatened by her naivety and worse, her cursed blood. That of a despised half Maharan.

Carter, her best friend and the heir to a political dynasty, is born into greatness. He defends and is utterly devoted to her, but cannot overcome his disgust that this nobody can surpass him. He likes the idea of a collectively better nation, just not when it jeopardizes his prospects.

A coming of age story set 10,000 years in the future, Overture examines the juxtaposing lives of these two friends. Soon, they wind up in a scramble to come out on the right side of history as Sei’s technological career and Carter’s political allegiance collide.  Both are forced to weigh the sacrifices they are willing to pay at the cost of cementing a legacy. Of being remembered. And how.

Overture is a completed 100,000 word piece. It is my debut novel, part one of six, and chapters are available upon request. Thank you for your time.

This is my query letter. One of hundreds that I wrote and agonized over. Like many elements of my life, I’m exquisitely, frustratingly hard to please. None of the versions I wrote were up to my standard.   But its needs to great, no one will read the manuscript if the letter is shit. So I work and continue on. I have revised the manuscript countless times. Agonized over phrasing and words and choices of people I know will never exist.

There is a reason to my insanity. Why I cant sleep at night. Why I did so much, why I continue to push the boundary of what I can do. This book is part of  my soul. I truly, sincerely believe that. I know I want to be great or nothing. It has been an endless, exhaustive effort. So be it. I know it is worthy of my efforts and I refuse to give up. 3 years of my life, the best of me has gone into making this. I don’t want this to be a half hearted endeavor and I will do what I must to publish it the right way. It won’t matter if 1 or 10 or 10 million read it. I will give my work every opportunity to further itself and I am anxious to see it progress.

That’s why I was so careful with this letter. I need an agent and a publishing house and a shot. The tone, the voice has been elusive, but I think I have found it. It came to me while listening to the Impossible Dream.  For such a shameless musical addict and theatre kid, one of the most iconic songs has evaded me. For goodness sakes, I am the person who reads encyclopedias from the 1960’s just to compare the nuances to current culture. That crazy, mad woman who inhales East of Eden, Watership Down, and anything classic instead of food because it nourishes me in ways that eating cannot. But I digress.

 Among my many endeavors, I am working my way through Don Quixote. Its punchy and witty and thicker than a good tomahawk steak, so its perfect for me. This song comes from the musical version, with Brian Mitchell as the titular character. Grace. Harmony. Incredibly technically difficult. I was moved to tears by this version as colors and shapes distorted my version.  It doesn’t happen often, but when the piece is particularly good, my mind does this odd trick. It will start to translate the music into visuals. The very same way it happened during the Porter Robinson concert, the night I penned the first pages of Overture. So I played the song throughout the night as I wrote this version of my letter. Did I do it right? I don’t know. Will this be the last revision? I would be a fool to say yes, but this what I’m going to send out. I hope I am enough. That 3 years of my life has been enough.

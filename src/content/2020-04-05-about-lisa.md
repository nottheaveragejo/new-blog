## Who am I

Lisa Jo is a New York native. A Chinese Cuban American female, she spent a great deal of her undergraduate career at Stony Brook University living a lie. It was only after a moment of lucid honesty did she make one of her best decisions and rejected her acceptance to grad school. Currently, she is a software engineer and loves every moment of it.

She has been a voracious reader throughout her life. In high school, she had a particularly astute set of teachers who encouraged not only her literary pursuits, but her academic advancement as well. Her favorite books include East of Eden, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Gone Girl, Flowers for Algernon, Their Eyes were Watching God, and Little Women, to name a few. Overture is her first work.

When she’s not eating her weight in ice cream and bubble tea or being a workaholic, she’s biking to the most remote spots in Manhattan. Currently, she lives in a 1 room apartment surrounded by plants and enjoys constructing miniature houses, meditating, cooking,yoga, and solving problems.

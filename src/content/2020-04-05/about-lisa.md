As I piece together the submissions for agents, they always ask for more. About the author, spacing, manuscripts, query letters. I can’t help but wonder will it ever be enough. I am not sure if I am any good, if I have any merit to be a writer. But no one reads this blog, so I don’t really mind the typos or if I ramble. Its more for my personal benefit than anything else.

I have rarely left since the coronavirus outbreak. The few ventures I dare to make are for food and supplies. The racial tension is high, I’ve been harassed more than a few times for being Asian. As a five foot four, one hundred and ten pound woman, it is just not safe to be outside. Seeing the numbers climb in cases in deaths, its horrifying. And yet, every day I look at the news, like some sort of terribly perverse game.

I am not a medical professional. I don’t have supplies or influence. I can’t help anyone. All I can do is stay inside. So that’s what I’m doing. I still wake up early. My days consist of meditation, yoga, writing, preparing this forsaken manuscript and agent package, doing the job that pays me to live, cooking, making miniatures, practicing algos, tending to my plants, reading, and I think this is pretty much everything. I have so much time and so very few excuses.  Distraction – that’s the key to how I’m handling this.

This time can either be used in despair, in worry and dread. And that helps no one. Not the workers or the economy or the jobless or the sick. Not a single person benefits from that. Or I can spend it bettering myself. Doing projects that have meaning to me.

I do miss the outside though. Biking to the abandoned train tracks and the beach. Buying bubble tea with sushi. Watching people pass by at Washington Square Park. I miss drinking and seeing friends. Of being able to move freely without fear. None of this is possible now, but they will return. This will pass and life will continue, like it always has.
